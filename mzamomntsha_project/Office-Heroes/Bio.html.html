			<h2> BACKGROUND </h2>
            <P>The Mzamomtsha Primay school was established in 2008 in driftsand city of cape town. The school was initially created for primary school students from grade 1 to grade 7, but due to the rapid population growth (births and migration) the school is also enrolling higher grades.

                Students are allowed up to grade 12 - which is the metric year. The rapid growth has lead to a series of problems for the Mzamomtsha Primary School. There are not enough classrooms, and the is not enough sufficient staff members to match the continuous growth. The school has 700 learners and a staff of 20 teachers. </P>
